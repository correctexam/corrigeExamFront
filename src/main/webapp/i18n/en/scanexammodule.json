This cache is then synchronized with the server so that it can be downloaded by a colleague accessing the exam correction or by yourself if you change browser or devices (correction on tablet for example). <This cache can be recreated at any time if necessary without any risk</b> of data loss. It is always possible to rebuild the cache by repeating step 2 click on <i>Reanalyze from pdf<i>, then repeat step 3 (page alignment). In each of these steps, you can see the state of the cache through the <i>thumbnail<i> part present in step 2, cache of unaligned images and step 3, cache of aligned images. </li><li> Step 4 allows each copy to be associated with one or more students present in the list of students imported when a module is created. </li><li> To access step 5 (Correct copy) and step 6 (View results) , the following condition must be satisfied: <br><b>number ofnonaligned pages in cache == nbrepagesaligned in cache and nbreassociationandstudent == nbrepagesaligned / nbrepagedintemplate. </b> <br>(For example, if I have three pages in my template, 12 pages in the scan pdf so 12 aligned images and 12 unaligned images in the cache and 4 associated copies then I can access the correction) If this condition is not met then it is not possible to access either the correction or the result phase. </li></ul><p>Very generally, if you encounter a problem at this point.
